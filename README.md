ESP8266 arduino AP mode,
ESP tries to connect to wifi AP, if it fail, start AP mode where you can choose wifi to connect. After submit module reboots and tries again to connect to that wifi.

Addes support for WEB UPDATE. On /upgrade you can choose compiled .bin with new firmware and just press upload.

In further development I want to add support of reloading div in page without reloading whole site.
